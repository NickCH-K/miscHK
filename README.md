# miscHK
This package contains some miscellaneous functions written by me, Nick Huntington-Klein. While there is no hard-and-fast theme, these generally fill gaps that make R easier to use. Notably, I am far more concerned with ease of use than with best programming practices, and you may find that some of these functions encourage laziness or some less-than-ideal practices. I do not have a problem with this. Begone, StackExchange.
