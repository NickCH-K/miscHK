Title: A Package of Miscellaneous Functions by Nick HK
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Nick", family = "Huntington-Klein", role = c("aut","cre"), email = "nhuntington-klein@seattleu.edu"))
Description: This package contains some miscellaneous functions written
    by me, Nick Huntington-Klein. While there is no hard-and-fast theme,
    these generally fill gaps that make R easier to use.
    Notably, I am far more concerned with ease of use than with best
    programming practices, and you may find that some of these functions
    encourage laziness or some less-than-ideal practices. I do not have a problem with this.
